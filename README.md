In this project, leverage Python for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Utilized Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch HTML data from target websites. This involves sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and extracting relevant data such as text, tables, or specific elements. Data is retrieved, preprocessed it using Pandas to convert it into a structured format which is the DataFrame. Clean the data by handling missing values, formatting issues, and removing duplicates or irrelevant entries. Applied Pandas functionalities for exploratory data analysis. Calculate descriptive statistics, visualize trends using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, and derive meaningful insights from the scraped data.This project demonstrates the power of Python and Pandas in web scraping and data analysis, enabling users to gather, process, and interpret data from diverse online sources efficiently.
